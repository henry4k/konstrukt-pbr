which means that the sum of all the BRDF weights across the hemisphere has to
be smaller or equal to one
"for all incoming light rays the sum of all the outgoing brdf weights
multiplied by the cosine of the angle must be smaller or equal to one".

L = radiance
Φ = radiant flux (in Watt) - total amount of enegery emitted by a light source
solid angle = Raumwinkel = Omega = ω = It's a way to measure how large an object appears to an observer looking from a point.
ωi = light dir
ωo = view dir
I = radiant intensity = flux (Watt) per solid angle
cosθ = NdotL
θ = theta = Winkel zwischen N und L
delta = winkel zwischen N und H
A = area affected by light = hemisphere

kd = einfallendes licht
ks = reflektierter anteil des einfallenden lichts

Flambert = diffuse komponente
Fcook-torrance = reflektierende komponente
